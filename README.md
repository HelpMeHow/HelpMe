## How It Works
Just copy and paste the following code into your readme.
```md
[![Help me with design](https://img.shields.io/badge/Help_Me_With-üé®Ô∏è_Design-blue)](./contributing.md)
```
You can replace "design" with any word which fits your need. Examples include docs, website, bugs, and issue#123. Emojis earn extra points!
