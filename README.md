## Why?
Open-Source contribution is a wonderful thing, but simply *wanting* to contribute can only go so far. For this reason, many projects have a `contributing.md`, which details the contribution process and the setup. The goal of HelpMe is to go even further, by promoting a readme badge which shows what exactly needs help.

## How it Works
Just copy and paste the following code into your readme.
```md
[![Help me with design](https://img.shields.io/badge/Help_Me_With-üé®Ô∏è_Design-blue)](./CONTRIBUTING.md)
```
- You can replace "design" with any word which fits your need. Examples include *docs*, *website*, *bugs*, and *issue#123*.
- In general, you should use a blue, "informational" color for your badge.
- Emojis earn extra points!
